Step 2: Once you cloned the repo,all the gradle dependencies should be resolved and available in your classpath to run the zuul router

Step 3: Now, you can run the app using Spring boot 'bootRun' command

Step 4: Once you have the app up and running, you can the health of the app using 'http://localhost:9090/actuator/health'. This should return '{"status":"UP"}'
